Hello, and welcome to my blog. I'm hoping to have a longer post up soon about what you'll be able to expect here, in the meantime this will be a preview. In short, I'm aiming for this to be a place to sketch out short and long form thoughts on anything, but likely AI/ML. I'll also use this as a place to explain a bit about a suite of personal projects I've been working on as I launch them (one of which being this WIP site, which is pretty barebones at the moment but I have ideas for where I want to take it). So, stay tuned.
